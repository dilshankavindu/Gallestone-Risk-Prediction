# Gallestone-Risk-Prediction
Excel / Python Project

Gallstone Prediction Using Logistic Regression + Excel Dashboard - 
This project applies logistic regression to predict gallstone status of patients using clinical and biochemical parameters, and presents the results through an interactive Excel dashboard.

Project Overview - 
Gallstones are hardened deposits in the gallbladder that can cause pain and complications. Early detection through predictive analytics supports better diagnosis and treatment decisions.

This project has two main components - 
Machine Learning Model – Predicts gallstone presence using logistic regression.
Excel Dashboard – Provides an interactive visualization of patient data, prediction results, and key insights.

Key Steps - 
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Removed missing values and handled outliers.
Encoded categorical variables.
Standardized numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - 
Used Python visualizations and Excel charts.
Analyzed correlations between predictors and gallstone status.

Feature Selection - 
Applied statistical tests and model-based methods to find the most important variables.

Model Building - 
Built a logistic regression classifier in Python.
Evaluated model with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

Excel Dashboard - 
Displays patient demographics, lab results, and prediction probabilities.
Includes interactive filters and summary metrics.
Enables healthcare professionals to quickly interpret results.

Technologies Used - 
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Excel: Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting
Jupyter Notebook for model development

Results - 
Achieved strong predictive performance for gallstone classification.
Dashboard allows non-technical users to explore and understand the data interactively.

Dataset - 
The dataset contains demographic, medical, and biochemical test results.
